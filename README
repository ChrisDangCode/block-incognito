I thought this would be a much longer project to try to block content from being shown while incognito but it turns out that,
at the time of writing (June 1, 2019) it's fairly easy to detect if you're incognito for Chrome.

Basically, using vanilla javascript, you just need to check if the file system API is present, and if the API isn't present, the user is incognito.

To check this, you can go to this github page: https://chrisdangcode.github.io/block-incognito/
